Plugin for CudaText.
Shows "Tabs" panel in the side-panel, with the list of opened editor-tabs.
Updates list when a file is opened or closed or changed.
Handles click on this list.

To open plugin at start (maybe not wanted, since it forces side-panel to show),
change the option in __init__.py file:
  option_open_at_start = True
